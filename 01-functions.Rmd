- **Functions**
  - **Concepts**
    - A function is a set of ordered one-to-one or many-to-one pairs of points (based on Spivak)
    - In a function, a number $f(x)$ is determined for each number $x$ in its domain
    - A function can be thought as a rule for a one-to-one or many-to-one mapping of an input into an output (in other words, for relating a set of input to a set of output)
    - It is useful to know that there is no best way of defining a function
    - **Domain** - The domain of a function is the set of input for which a unique output exist for every point in the set of input 
    - **Range** - The codomain or range of a function is the set of output that a function can produce
  - **Related concepts (brief)**
    - **Root of a function** - The root of a function is the point in the domain (or one of the domains in the multivariable case) of the function when the codomain is 0
    - **Intercept of a function** - The intercept of a function is the point in the codomain of the function when the domain is 0
    - **Inverse of a function** - A function that undoes the operation of a function of interest - Mapping the output into the input 
    - **Extremum of a function** - The most extreme point in the codomain of the function
    - **Composition of multiple functions** - A function that is made up by several functions through basic operations (e.g. sum, product, quotient)
    - **Ordered pairs** - Pairs where the order of elements in them matters - E.g. if (a, b) = (c, d), then a = c and b = d. An ordered pair $(a, b)$ is defined as $\{\{a\}, \{a, b\}\}$
    

- **The Limit of a function**
  - **Introduction**
    - The notion of the limit of a function is the foundation of calculus (e.g. functions, continuity, differentiation, integration etc.)
  - **Conceptual definition**
    - The limit ($l$) of a function ($f$) as the input ($x$) of the function approaches/tends towards/is near $a$ is a single value (if any) that the function approaches/tends towards/becomes closer to from either side when the input of the function approaches/tends towards/become closer to $a$ from either side, but not $a$
    - That means the limit of a function near $a$ exists only when the function does in fact approach towards the limit $l$ (i.e. a single value) when the input approaches towards $a$. However, when the function does not approach towards the limit $l$ when the input approaches towards $a$, then the limit of the function near $a$ does not exist 
    - The notion of a function approaching a limit describes the value of the input of the function as approaching a certain value from either side as the value of the output of the function approaches the limit from either side of it 
    - In other words, it describes the value that the input needs to be close to or approach to in order to get a value of the output of the function close to or approaches the limit 
  - **Mathematical expression**
    - **Expression 1 (Hardy)**
      - $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = l$
        - ***Notes***
          - It reads "The limit of the function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $l$"
    - **Expression 2**
      - $f(x) \rightarrow l ~~~~~\text{as} ~~~~~ x \rightarrow a$
        - ***Notes**
          - It reads "$f(x)$ approaches $l$ as $x$ approaches $a$
  - **Precise definition**
    - The function $f$ approaches the limit $l$ near $a$ is defined as the closeness around $a$ for any given closeness around $l$ with closeness defined as intervals around $l$ and $a$- Specifically, an interval around the limit of any given distance $\varepsilon$ between the limit and either of its boundaries always has a corresponding interval around $a$ with a certain distance $\delta$ between $a$ and either of its boundaries such that any values within the interval around $a$ is mapped by the function into values that is guaranteed to be within the aforementioned interval around the limit
  - **Mathematics**
    - For every $\epsilon > 0$ there is some $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $x$, if $0 < |x - a| < \delta$, then it implies $|f(x) - l| < \varepsilon$ 
  - **Theories**
    - **Theorem 1**
      - **Concept**
        - A function $f$ can only have one limit $l$ near $a$
    - **Properties of Limits**
      - **Concept**
        - If $x$ is close to $x_0$ and $y$ is close to $y_0$, then $x + y$ is close to $x_0 + y_0$, and $xy$ is close to $x_0y_0$, and $\frac{1}{y}$ is close to $\frac{1}{y_0}$ 
      - **Mathematics**
        - If $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = l$ and $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x) = m$, then 
          - **The constant law of limits**
            - **Mathematics**
              - $\lim_{x \rightarrow a}c = c$
          - **The sum law of limits**
            - **Mathematics**
              - $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a}(f ± g)(x) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) ± \lim_{x \rightarrow a}g(x) = l ± m$ 
            - **Proof**
              - Given that 
                - $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} = L \\ ~~~~~ \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \text{s.t}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies 0 < |f(x) - L| < \epsilon \\ \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} = M \\ ~~~~~ \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \text{s.t}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies 0 < |g(x) - M| < \epsilon$
              - We are trying to prove:
                - $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a}(f + g)(x) = L + M\\ ~~~~~  \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \text{s.t}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies 0 < |f(x) + g(x) - L - M| < \epsilon$
              - We can rearrange the last bit as 
                - $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \text{s.t}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies 0 < |f(x) - L + g(x) - M| < \epsilon$
              - So that we can use the Triangle Inequality to separate the last term as 
                - $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \text{s.t}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies 0 < |f(x) - l + g(x) - M| ≤ |f(x) - L| + |g(x) - M| < \epsilon$
              - We need to make this statement work by adjusting the $\epsilon$ and $\delta$: 
                - $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} = L \\ ~~~~~ \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta_1 > 0, \text{s.t}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < |x - a| < \delta_1 \implies 0 < |f(x) - L| < \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\ \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} = M \\ ~~~~~ \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta_2 > 0, \text{s.t}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < |x - a| < \delta_2 \implies 0 < |g(x) - M| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$
                  - ***Note***
                    - Now we adjust the $\epsion$ to $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$, so that when they are added up, they are equal to $\epsilon$. Reducing $\epsilon$ to $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ may also reduce the corresponding $\delta_1$, which is for $\lim_{x \rightarrow a}f(x)$, and $delta_2$, which is for $\lim_{x \rightarrow a}g(x)$ 
              - Now back to this thing: 
                - $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \text{s.t}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies 0 < |f(x) - l + g(x) - M| ≤ |f(x) - L| + |g(x) - M| < \epsilon$
              - Let $\delta$ in this thing be $\min(\delta_1, \delta_2)$ (because the smaller $\delta$ will ensure that it will work for both $\lim_{x \rightarrow a}f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \rightarrow a}g(x)$ in that thing)
              - Consequently: 
                - $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta = \min(\delta_1, \delta_2) > 0, \text{s.t}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, 0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies 0 < |f(x) - l + g(x) - M| ≤ |f(x) - L| + |g(x) - M| < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} < \epsilon \blacksquare$

          - **The multiplicative law of limits**
            - **Mathematics**
              - $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a}(f \times g)(x) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) \times \lim_{x \rightarrow a}g(x) = l \times m$
          - **The quotient law of limits**
            - **Mathematics**
              - $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a}(\frac{1}{g})(x) = \frac{1}{\lim_{x \rightarrow a}g(x)} = \frac{1}{m} ~~ \text{if}~~ m ≠ 0$
